    <p class="sent">Lately when I wake up and look at the Africa around me
I recognize the opportunity this new Africa represents in
the age of AI and smart technology.The possibilities that
abound with the use of data and solutions that can change
lives in Health, Education, Deep-Tech, Research, Fintech,
Agritech and Climate Change.<br><br>
Africa must embrace and adopt AI as a key, if not the most
important, form of technology to make sure we are truly
part of the 4th Industrial Revolution.At the moment we are
not doing a very good job in AI across the continent and
falling behind in four key areas, namely;<br><br>
1. Investing in AI research across the continent<br>
2. Training more AI engineers & creating an enabling
environment for them to become creative.<br>
3. Investing in AI start-ups in Africa.<br>
4. Investing in Infrastructure required to support AI.<br><br>
I believe a data driven ecosystem with innovation at the
center of it, and education as a core value, is critical if we
are going to improve the state of AI in Africa. We must
educate everyone on the value chain to become better
experienced and knowledge about the value, as well
as the urgent need, for an increased focus on AI in the
continent.<br><br>
Currently a number of factors are frustrating the growth
of the AI ecosystem allied to the lack of African business
leaders who are knowledgeable enough to advocate
for AI in the continent.I believe the opportunity lies
in the start-up space to become a key driver for the </p>

            <div class="right">
<p class="come"><br><br><br><br><br>development of the AI ecosystem in Africa.<br>As a continent
we have abundant human talent and resources. If applied
accurately AI can help tackle a number of social and
economic problems across the continent.<br><br> Some key
African countries have started driving the conversation,
namely; Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Rwanda, Ghana,
Egypt, Tunisia and Senegal.<br><br>
Connecting the important actors and experts within
the field of AI is also of immense importance, with
communities such as Zindi, AICE, Data Science Nigeria to
name but a few building AI labs and education networks
of young professionals.<br><br>
I believe that Africa is in a fantastic position to drive and
embrace AI. Free flow of data across various sectors
as well as the big companies coming to Africa must
support the growth of the start-ups in AI and also help
governments understand the value of investment in AI.<br><br>
Finally, we are now slowly seeing the funding of African AI
start-ups but we need more early stage AI companies in
Africa getting funded for the space to grow rapidly.<br><br>
To conclude, AI needs to become an important part of
the African agenda for sustainable growth and all the key
players need to come to the table and actively participate
so we donâ€™t get left out of another industrial revolution.<br><br>
